## General Info
This firmware isn't the official release of the MakerTech-Team, it is only a community Firmware! Always make sure the provided firmware fits your printer and current environment because it could permanently damage your board or components of your printer!

The base of this firmware was the SKR Marlin Firmware from BTT (https://github.com/bigtreetech/SKR-2/tree/master/Firmware/Marlin-bugfix-2.0.9.2.x) it was changed to fit the ProForge 3 printer from MakerTech.

All Changes made in the Firmware were tagged with "//Proforge" and maybe a short description, depending on the text.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
